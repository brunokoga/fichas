####Feats
**Psionic Shot (Psionic)**
While you maintain psionic focus, your attacks with a ranged weapon deal an extra 1 point of damage. Additionally, if you expend your psionic focus as part of an attack with a ranged weapon, that attack instead deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

**Point-Blank Shot (Combat)**
You are especially accurate when making ranged attacks against close targets.
You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.

**Precise Shot (Combat)**
You are adept at firing ranged attacks into melee.
You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard –4 penalty on your attack roll.
Note: Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the other.

####Traits
**Warrior of Old**: As a child, you put in long hours in combat drills, and though time has made this training a dim memory, you still have a knack for quickly responding to trouble. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks.

**Desert Child**: You were born and raised in rocky deserts. You are accustomed to high temperatures, and gain a +4 trait bonus on any saving throws made to resist the effects of being in hot conditions and a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against fire effects.

####Special Qualities
**Wind Reader (Su)**
A Marksman can use her heightened senses and awareness of her surroundings to read the wind and environment, allowing her to drastically improve her accuracy. While maintaining psionic focus, she can spend a swift action to gain a competence bonus equal to her Wisdom modifier on ranged attacks until the end of the round. She can do this a number of times per day equal to 3 + her class level.

**Style Technique**
May expend psionic focus while making a single ranged attack to add her Wisdom modifier to the damage the attack deals. This ability may not be used as part of a full attack.

**Style Skill**
At 3rd level, a sniper Marksman gains a +1 bonus to Stealth. This bonus increases by 1 every three Marksman levels thereafter.

**Style Mantra**
Beginning at 3rd level, as long as a sniper Marksman maintains psionic focus, she gains a +2 competence bonus on damage rolls for attacks made with a ranged or thrown weapon. At 7th level and every four Marksman levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1. A Marksman may not use her style mantra at the same time she uses Wind Reader; she may only gain the benefit of one or the other, not both.

**Favored Weapon (Bows and Crossbows)**
Marksmen of 2nd level select a group of ranged weapons as their preferred weapons (bows and crossbows) and gain a +1 competence bonus to ranged attack rolls made with any weapon of that group. Every four Marksman levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1.

**Evade Arrows (Ex)**
At 2nd level, a Marksman's familiarity with ranged attacks and her natural intuition alerts her to danger from mundane ranged attacks. She gains a +1 Dodge bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks (but not ranged touch attacks). At 6th level and every four Marksman levels thereafter, this Dodge bonus increases by 1.

**Second Chance (Su)**
A sniper Marksman of 4th level may expend her psionic focus when a ranged attack she has made misses to reroll the attack. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the Marksman’s Wisdom modifier.

**Cover Fire (Ex)**
Beginning at 4th level, the Marksman knows not only how to directly engage her enemies, but also how to protect her allies. As an attack action, she may choose to fire a ranged or thrown weapon at an opponent within 30 feet to distract that opponent rather than to deal damage. Make an attack roll against the space a target occupies (AC 10). If successful, the targeted enemy must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + one-half the Marksman's class level + the Marksman's Dexterity modifier), or be staggered for one round. The Marksman still expends ammunition as normal for this attack.
If the attack roll would indicate a critical threat and the result would hit the opponent's AC, roll to confirm: if the critical hit is confirmed against the opponent's AC, the attack does normal damage as well. A Marksman cannot use cover fire if her opponent or the square she targets would be subject to a miss chance (such as from a concealed target).

####Psionic Powers Known
**Deflect Missiles**
Display: Mental, Visual
Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
Range: personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 rnd /level (D) or until discharged
Power Points: 1
You surround yourself in a field that slows ranged attacks. You gain damage reduction 10/magic against ranged or thrown weapons. This effect ends once it has blocked 10 points of damage. You do not gain the ability to damage creatures with similar damage reduction. This ability does not work on weapon-like spells or powers.
Augment This power may be augmented in the following ways.
1. For every additional power point spent, the power can block an additional 10 points of damage before it ends.
2. If you spend 6 additional power points, you may manifest this power as a swift action.

**Inevitable Strike**
Display Visual
Casting Time 1 swift action
Range Personal
Target you
Duration See text
Power Points: 1
You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future during your next attack. Your next single attack roll (if it is made before the end of the next round) gains a +5 insight bonus. Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.
Augment: This power may be augmented in one or both of the following ways.
1. You can increase the manifesting time to 1 standard action and increase the insight bonus to +20.
2. For every additional power point spent, the insight bonus increases by 2, but the total bonus may not exceed +25.

**Burst**
Display Auditory
Manifesting Time 1 swift action
Range Personal
Target You
Duration 1 round
Power Points 1
This power increases your land speed by 10 feet. This adjustment counts as an enhancement bonus to speed.
Augment For every 4 additional power points you spend, the enhancement bonus to speed increases by 10 feet.

**Float**
Display: auditory
Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: you
Duration: 1 rnd./lvl. (D)
Power Points: psionic focus or 1
You mentally support yourself in water or similar liquid. You can swim at a speed of 5 feet using the power alone, or, if you already have a swim speed, this power boosts your swim speed by 5 feet.

**Trick Shot**

By altering the levels of probability surrounding a small object in motion, you can ‘trick' it into performing seemingly impossible maneuvers. While this ability has no direct influence on an attack roll, it can nevertheless make a certain outcome possible in the first place. Until the beginning of your next turn, you may make one Tiny or smaller moving object perform a ‘trick shot' -- a stunt that you describe -- so long as it is not moving under its own power (thrown objects or fired projectiles are not moving under their own power, while an insect or a flying psicrystal are). So long as the stunt can be succinctly described in ten words or less, it occurs, no matter how unlikely this is. This trick shot has no influence on attack or damage rolls, although the effect itself may allow an attack to occur. Example trick shots include the following (which are descriptive and of varying complexity; the sentences used in manifesting are shorter): - Shooting an arrow through the sockets of twelve axe heads between you and your target - Bouncing a billiard ball off of nine different fixtures (including your friend's breastplate) before sinking in a pocket - Having a crossbow bolt “loop the loop” before impacting normally - Forcing a tossed coin to land, perfectly stable, on its edge - Getting a javelin to slalom around trees between you and your target - Directing the tiny bead of an undetonated fireball to fly a “figure eight” around its target's feet - Allowing a dagger, despite being pointy, to bounce off of the ground between a creature's legs and continue unhindered to its actual target behind him

Additional trick shots beyond this list are possible.

From a combat perspective, the most powerful use of this power would be to shoot around corners, but doing so is treated as shooting blind. It is more frequently used, however, to show off outside of combat.

Augment: You may augment this power in one or more of the following ways.

1. Each additional power point spent allows you to affect one additional object before the power ends, although this cannot allow you to make more attacks in a standard attack or full attack than normal.

2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, the size of an object you can affect with this power increases one step.

3. For every additional power point you spend, the power's duration extends 1 round. The number of objects you can alter this way remains unchanged, and the power still ends when these run out.

Additionally, every additional power point spent to achieve any of these effects allows for your trick shots to be described in sentences of up to one word longer.
