Psionic Shot [Psionic]
You can charge your ranged attacks with additional damage potential.

Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot.

Benefit: While you maintain psionic focus, your attacks with a ranged weapon deal an extra 1 point of damage. Additionally, if you expend your psionic focus as part of an attack with a ranged weapon, that attack instead deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

Point-Blank Shot (Combat)
You are especially accurate when making ranged attacks against close targets.

Benefit: You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.

Precise Shot (Combat)
You are adept at firing ranged attacks into melee.

Prerequisite: Point-Blank Shot.

Benefit: You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard –4 penalty on your attack roll.

Note: Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the other.


Wind Reader (Su)

A Marksman can use her heightened senses and awareness of her surroundings to read the wind and environment, allowing her to drastically improve her accuracy. While maintaining psionic focus, she can spend a swift action to gain a competence bonus equal to her Wisdom modifier on ranged attacks until the end of the round. She can do this a number of times per day equal to 3 + her class level.

Style Technique

Once a Marksman has reached 2nd level, she may expend her psionic focus while making a single ranged attack to add her Wisdom modifier to the damage the attack deals. This ability may not be used as part of a full attack.

Style Skill

At 3rd level, a sniper Marksman gains a +1 bonus to Stealth. This bonus increases by 1 every three Marksman levels thereafter.

Style Mantra

Beginning at 3rd level, as long as a sniper Marksman maintains psionic focus, she gains a +2 competence bonus on damage rolls for attacks made with a ranged or thrown weapon. At 7th level and every four Marksman levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1.

Favored Weapon

Marksmen of 2nd level select a group of ranged weapons from the list below as their preferred weapons and gain a +1 competence bonus to ranged attack rolls made with any weapon of that group. Every four Marksman levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1.

Bows: composite longbow, composite shortbow, longbow, and shortbow.
Crossbows: double crossbow, hand crossbow, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, repeating heavy crossbow, and repeating light crossbow.

Evade Arrows (Ex)

At 2nd level, a Marksman's familiarity with ranged attacks and her natural intuition alerts her to danger from mundane ranged attacks. She gains a +1 Dodge bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks (but not ranged touch attacks). At 6th level and every four Marksman levels thereafter, this Dodge bonus increases by 1.
