####Special Qualities

**Smite (Su)**: Once per day, you can call out to the powers of your element to aid you against your foes. As a swift action, you choose one target within sight to smite. You add your Cha bonus (if any) to your attack rolls and add your elemental warrior level to all damage rolls made against the target of your smite.In addition, while smite is in effect, you gain a deflection bonus equal to you Charisma modifier (if any) to your AC against attacks made by the target of the smite.
The smite effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time you rest and regain your use of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, you may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 4â€“9: The Elemental Warrior, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.

**Lay On Hands (Su)**: Beginning at 2nd level, you can heal wounds (your own or those of others) by touch. Each day you can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 your elemental warrior level plus your Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, you can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two elemental warrior levels you possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless you target yourself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, you only need one free hand to use this ability.Alternatively, you can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels you possess. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.

**Aura of Courage (Su)**: At 3rd level, you are immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of you gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while you are conscious, not if you are unconscious or dead.

**Divine Health (Ex)**: At 3rd level, you are immune to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases, including mummy rot.

**Mercy (Su)**: (Fatigued) At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, you can select one mercy. Each mercy adds an effect to your lay on hands ability. Whenever you uses lay on hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the mercies possessed by you. A mercy can remove a condition caused by a curse, disease, or poison without curing the affliction. Such conditions return after 1 hour unless the mercy actually removes the affliction that causes the condition.

####Traits

**Desert Child (desert)**: You were born and raised in rocky deserts. You are accustomed to high temperatures, and gain a +4 trait bonus on any saving throws made to resist the effects of being in hot conditions and a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against fire effects.
